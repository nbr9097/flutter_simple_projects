# 📚 Flutter Simple Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Flutter applications that I built during my Flutter learning journey as an **Intern at Aufait**.  
Each mini-project helped me practice core Flutter concepts like widgets, layouts, state management, navigation, and clean UI design.

This repo will continue to grow as I learn more and build new apps.

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository

- Track my **Flutter learning progress**
- Build **small, focused projects** to understand key concepts
- Practice **clean folder structure** and code organization
- Maintain separate **app folders**, each with its own README
- Improve Git/GitHub workflow (branches, commits, PRs)

## 🧪 How to Run Any App

1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd project_name
   flutter pub get
   flutter run

## ✨ My Learning Highlights
### While building these apps, I learned:

- Core Flutter UI & widget structures

- Organizing code using folders (models, views, widgets)

- Using Git branches for feature development

- Creating README files for documentation

- Building clean and simple UI

- Debugging & running Flutter apps efficiently
